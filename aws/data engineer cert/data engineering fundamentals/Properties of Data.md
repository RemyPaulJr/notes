- Volume
	- How much data are we talking?
	- Characteristics:
		- Range from gigabytes to petabytes or even more
		- challenges in storing, processing, and analyzing high volumes of data
	- Examples:
		- Social media platform processing terabytes of data daily from user posts, images, and videos
		- Retailers collecting year's worth of transaction data, amounting to several petabytes
	- Volume of data will determine how you store and process your data pipeline.
- Velocity
	- Speed at which new data is generated, collected, and processed.
	- Characteristics:
		- High velocity requires real-time or near-real-time processing capabilities
		- Rapid ingestion and processing can be critical for certain applications
	- Examples:
		- Sensor data from IoT devices streaming readings every millisecond
		- High-frequency trading systems where milliseconds make the difference
- Variety
	- Type of data, structures, and sources of data.
	- Characteristics:
		- Data can be structured, unstructured, or semi-structured
		- Can come from multiple sources in various formats
	- Example:
		- business analyzing data from a rds (structured), emails (unstructured), and JSON logs (semi-structured)
		- Healthcare systems collecting data from electronic medical records, wearable health devices, and patient feedback forms
