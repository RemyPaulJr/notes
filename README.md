## **My Notes**

- Currently working on a DataPipeline
	- Extracting Data from API via Python requests library
	- Load Data into Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
	- Load Data into Snowflake
	- Transform Data
- Load Data into GCS again
- Load Data into BigQuery
- Load Data into PowerBI maybe, will decide once I get closer to this step
- Automate Pipeline via Airflow. Batch processing Jobs on set intervals
