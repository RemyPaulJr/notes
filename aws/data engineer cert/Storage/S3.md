Buckets
- allows people to store objects (files) in 'buckets' (directories)
- buckets must have a globally unique name (across all region all accounts)
- buckets are defined at the region level
- looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- naming convention:
	- no uppercase or underscore
	- 3063 characters
	- not an ip
	- start with lowercase or a number
	- not start with the prefix xn--
	- not end with the suffix -s3alias

Objects
- Objects (files) have a Key
- the key is the full path:
	- s3://my-bucket/**my_file.txt**
	- s3://my-bucket/**my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt**
- the key is composed of *prefix* + **object name**
	- s3://my-bucket/*my_folder1/another_folder*/**my_file.txt**
- there's no concept of "directories" within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
- just keys with very long names that contain slashes ("/")
- Objects values are the content of the body:
	- Max. Object Size is 5TB (500GB)
	- if uploading more than 5GB, must use "multi-part upload" (upload the file into multiple parts)
- Metadata (list of text key / value pairs - system or user metadata)
- tags (unicode key / value pair - up to 10) - useful for security / lifecycle
- version id (if versioning is enabled)
