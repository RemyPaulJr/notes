Replication (CRR & SRR)

- Must enable versioning in source and destination buckets
- Cross-Region replication (CRR)
- Same-Region Replication (SRR)
- Buckets can be in different AWS accounts.
- Copying is asynchronous
- Must give proper IAM permissions to S3
- Use cases:
	- CRR - compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
	- SRR - log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts
---
- After you enable Replication only new objects are replicated
- you can replicate existing objects using S3 Batch Replication
	- Replicates existing objects and objects that failed replication
- For DELETE operations
	- Can replicate delete markers from source to target (optional setting)
	- Deletions with a version ID are not replicated (to avoid malicious deletes)
- There is no "chaining" of replication
	- If bucket 1 has replication into bucket 2, which has replication into bucket 3
	- Then objects created in bucket 1 are not replicated to bucket 3
