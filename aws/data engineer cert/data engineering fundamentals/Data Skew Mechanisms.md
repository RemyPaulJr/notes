- Data skew refers to the unequal distribution or imbalance of data across various nodes or partitions in distributed computing systems.
- "The celebrity problem"
	- Even partitioning doesn't work if you traffic is uneven
	- Imagine you're IMDb... Brad Pitt could overload his partition
- Causes:
	- Non-uniform distribution of data
	- Inadequate partition strategy
	- Temporal skew
- Important to monitor data distribution and alert when skew issues arise.
**Addressing Data Skew**
- Adaptive Partitioning: Dynamically adjusting partition based on data characteristics to ensure a more balanced distribution.
- Salting: Introduce a random factor or "salt" to the data to distribute it more uniformly.
- Repartitioning: Regularly redistribute the data based on tis current distribution  characteristics.
- Sampling: Use a sample of the data to determine the distribution and adjust the processing strategy accordingly.
- Custom Partitioning: Define custom rules or functions for partitioning data based on domain knowledge
