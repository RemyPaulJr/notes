### **What I worked on today**
- Attempt to clean up code.
- Inserting transformed data (cleaned & validated) into silver layer/table in Snowflake.
- Created aggregated data for Gold Layer/Views to answer business questions in business doc.
- Loaded aggregated views into GCS bucket in Parquet file format.
### **What's next**
- Load Parquet files into Google Cloud BigQuery from GCS.
- Preferably using some sort of python script and maybe Cloud Functions? To make the transition to Airflow DAG easier down the line.
- Setup BigQuery table.
