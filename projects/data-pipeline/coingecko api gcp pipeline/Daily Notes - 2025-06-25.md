### **What I worked on today**
- Created Silver layer ddl. Created table in snowflake. Changed column names to be more consistent, meaningful, and well-labeled.
- Ran into an issue so to speak. That spawned another issue to speak.
	- 1st I noticed the entire ingestion_timestamp column was NULL. From my research it looks like Snowflake doesn't like different time formats for different columns
